# 6.5 Jugs of Water: You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited
# supply of water (but no measuring cups). How would you come up with exactly four
# quarts of water? Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly
# "half" of the jug would be impossible.

# I will list the states of the two jugs in each step. The numbers outside the
# parentheses represent the volume of the jug while the numbers inside represent
# the volume of the water in that jug. The change of volume of each step is caused
# by either water supply/pouring or water transition between the two jugs.
